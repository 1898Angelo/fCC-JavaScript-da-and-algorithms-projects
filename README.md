# FCC JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures Projects

Just to show the projects I made for freeCodeCamp's Algorithms & Data Structures course. The course focuses on teaching JavaScript from the ground up, but with no external libraries nor local runtime environments for JavaScript (like Node.js).

The projects can be visualized on my [CodePen's collection](https://codepen.io/collection/eJEMkx) or by clicking on my [certification (automatically) issued by freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/1898Angelo/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8).

No code or styling was provided for the realization of any of the projects.
